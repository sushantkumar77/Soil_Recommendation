Here's a README.md file template for a Soil Health Recommendation System project. You can copy and modify it based on your exact project details:

# 🌱 Soil Health Recommendation System

This project predicts **soil nitrogen content** using satellite band data and recommends actions to improve soil health. It leverages advanced machine learning models such as **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **Random Forest** to provide accurate nitrogen level predictions and actionable insights for farmers or agricultural stakeholders.


## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict nitrogen content from satellite spectral band data (e.g., B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, NDVI).
- Achieve high accuracy (R² score > 80%) using ensemble models.
- Recommend soil improvement measures based on predicted nitrogen levels.

## 🧪 Models Used

- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- LightGBM Regressor

All models were evaluated based on:
- R² Score
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## 📊 Model Performance (Sample)

| Model       | R² Score | RMSE  | MAE   | MAPE  |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| XGBoost     | 0.89     | 2.13  | 1.51  | 11.2% |
| LightGBM    | 0.88     | 2.20  | 1.57  | 12.1% |
| RandomForest| 0.85     | 2.35  | 1.66  | 13.4% |

## 🧠 Recommendations Based on Nitrogen Levels

| Nitrogen Level | Recommendation                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Low (< 40)     | Apply nitrogen-based fertilizers       |
| Medium (40–80) | Monitor regularly, apply organic mulch |
| High (> 80)    | Reduce fertilizer, rotate crops        |
